Step-by-Step
============

This example demonstrates how to use SmoothQuant along with PTQ on stable diffusion XL model to accelerate inference while maintain the quality of output image.

# Prerequisite

## Environment
Recommend python 3.9 or higher version.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run example

Use below command to run this example.
```bash
python sdxl_smooth_quant.py --model_name_or_path stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0
```

# Results

Here is the comparison of images generated by the BF16 model (left) and INT8 model (right) respectively:

<p float="left">
  <img src="./images/bf16.jpg" width = "300" height = "300" alt="bf16" align=center />
  <img src="./images/int8.jpg" width = "300" height = "300" alt="int8" align=center />
</p>
