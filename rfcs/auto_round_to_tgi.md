## Add Auto-Round Support

Hi, here is the INC team from Intel. Thank you for developing this amazing project.

### Motivation 

Our team have developed a new weight-only quantization algorithm called Auto-Round. It has achieved superior accuracy compared to [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323), [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978), [OmniQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13137), and [HQQ](https://mobiusml.github.io/hqq_blog/) across 11 tasks, particularly excelling in low-bit quantization (e.g., 2-bits and 3-bits). Auto-Round supports quantization from 2 to 8 bits, involves low tuning costs, and imposes no additional overhead during inference. Key results are summarized below, with detailed information available in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05516) and [code repository](https://github.com/intel/auto-round/blob/main/docs/acc.md).

<!-- Key result table -->

We would like to contribute this quantization algorithm to TGI to enable users to:

1. Quantize a floating model using Auto-Round.
2. Perform inference using the quantized model.

### 1. Quantize Floating Model Using Auto-Round

Extend the current `quantize` API and add `method` as a new argument to select different algorithms. Users can utilize it as follows:

```bash
text-generation-server quantize \
    --MODEL_ID path/to/float/model/\
    --OUTPUT_DIR /path/to/save/quantized/model \
    --method autoround # <--- select the different methods, such as `gptq`, `autoround`
```

We propose two options to implement it:

#### Option 1: Adding Auto-Round as a New Python Dependency (Recommended)

Auto-Round is currently released as a pure [Python binary](). TGI can include `auto-round` in `requirements.txt` and utilize Auto-Round's API to obtain the quantized model.

Advantages:

- Minimal maintenance effort for TGI. We already integrated it into our [INC](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) project, and enabled the integration tests.
- Easy synchronization with new enhancements. As we continually improve the Auto-Round algorithm, updates can be effortlessly incorporated into TGI by updating the package version.

### Option 2: Porting all source code of auto-round into TGI

We are also willing to integrate all source code of Auto-Round directly into TGI.  

Advantages:

- No third-party dependency introduced.
- TCI maintainers have better control.
